## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fred, a passionate student who's enthusiastic about coding and technology. ðŸš€ Currently, I'm pursuing my studies with a focus on Information  Technology  at Evelyn Hone College . My journey into the world of programming started when I was 17 and since then, I've been hooked on bringing creative ideas to life through code.

### What I'm Into

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning and experimenting with C++,Python and html (web development.)

ðŸ”­ I'm also planning to start working on projects, where I'm applying what I've learned to solve real-world problems.

ðŸ’¬ Let's connect and chat  or collaborate on projects related to any kind of coding and excel and learn together

### Get in Touch

Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
